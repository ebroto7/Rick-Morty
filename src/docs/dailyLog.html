        <h3> Friday 4 </h3>
        <p> - I start the day by reading the documentation and doing a little brainstorming on how I want to approach the project and what things I want to do.
            <br>- I create a ClickUp, to order all the tasks
            <br>- And make me a small diagram of how I want to visually organize the web.
            <br>- From there, the project began. For this, what I do is create the project in VSC and local, create the repository in Github, clone it and link it to the local one. Once I have the local repository, I start the installation of the typscript and Bootstrap packages with which I am going to carry out the project.
            <br>- Once the project is initialized, I start by creating the web outline in html and giving some basic styles in css to be able to visualize what I want.
            <br>- The next step would be to import the interfaces that I was going to use when importing the API data (I admit that here I was ahead of what I was playing)
            <br>- Finally try to start creating the side menu with the list of episodes

        <h3> Saturday 5 </h3>
        <p>- As I thought that I would be short of time to carry out the project during the week, I decided to dedicate a few hours on the weekend
            <br>- So, I started by looking at Bootstrap for a nice and useful way to sort the chapter listing links. I liked him. Accordion mode, as I found it to be a very neat shape
            <br>- Once the container was ready, I needed to collect the list of chapters and separate it by seasons. To be honest, I thought it was going to cost me more, but I immediately understood that one of the parameters that the episode interface returned to me was a code. I just needed to extract the season number with a string method.
            <br>- I managed to carry out this operation and motivated by having achieved the purposes, I decided to continue a little more by adding functionality to these buttons.
            <br>- The next step was to add a listener and create a function. The function that will create the container for the display of the episode and all its elements.
            <br>- I managed to visualize it, and incorporate the information of the episode, without styles, and I ended the session.

        <h3> Monday 7</h3>
        <p>- On Monday it was hard for me to start, I was tired from the weekend, so I preferred to start giving some styles to be able to ethically shape the page. 
            <br>- As the day progressed I woke up and started adding new features, I already had the list of characters and their cards created, I had to convert them to a button and this button would open the modal with its information.
            <br>- The truth is that I realized that I was repeating the same operation as with the list of episodes, so it didn't cost me much to make this new functionality.
            <br>- I felt a little scattered and worked a little messy, while adding functionality gave styles. As I worked a little senselessly, I made mistakes that he later had to correct.
            <br>- I finally decided to fold a bit earlier.

        <h3> Tuesday 8</h3>
        <p>- On Tuesday I preferred to start by adding the footer and giving some styles that I was missing.
            <br>- From there, I was missing the final functionality, adding the Location screen, it opened when the modal button was clicked. Once again he was repeating the same process, from a list of elements he selected a specific one and opened a new container with his information.
            <br>- Again, it didn't take me long to do this process. Also, it was easy because I only had to reuse some functions created.
            <br>- Unfortunately it was not that simple, and I got some errors. For example, when reusing the episode view container, the information on the screen multiplied. So I had to spend a long time finding the error and correcting it.
            <br>- I realized that having created the episode view container in html, painting it with the information of the selected episode, emptying it and filling it with the location information was not a good idea, because when I selected another episode again, there was no container to put the new one in. episode. So I had to empty the html and create it in the js. In this way if I could reuse the container.
            <br>- Once this correction is done, I just need to give the final styles and add some extra ones that I had thought of.
            <br>- I admit that I started very quiet on Wednesday, actually, in the absence of some details, I already had the project resolved

        <h3> Wednesday 9</h3>
        <p>- I admit that I started very quiet on Wednesday, actually, in the absence of some details, I already had the project resolved.
            <br>- I started making some corrections, and I realized that there were some more styling errors that I needed to fix but it seemed like a small thing to me and I wasn't in a big rush. So as some colleagues were more overwhelmed and asked me for help, I began to dedicate time to them.
            <br>- I admit that I felt comfortable in this role, and little by little I was putting aside my project to help those who asked me.
            <br>- In between I was doing some corrections of my own project.

        <h3> Thursday 10</h3>
        <p>- The truth is that on Thursday I spent almost 100x100 helping. Without realizing that I was stopping doing some things that I needed
            <br>- So in the afternoon I had to dedicate time to my project, which stressed me a bit because I realized that there were more things missing than I thought and that I had a big mistake that I didn't know how to correct and I was running out of time.

        <h3> Friday 11</h3>
        <p>- I start the day stressed, I have an important error and I can't solve it, basically because I don't understand what is failing.
            <br>- I ask Manu for help and thanks to him we see the error, luckily solving it is easy and I don't have much time.
            <br>- Once again a couple of colleagues ask me for help and, although I still have some details to close, and make the delivery, I prefer to "throw them a line"
            <br>- Once again now I'm in a hurry to close my project. I make some last style corrections and prepare the readme and dailyLog documents.
            <br>- I make a last push of the project.
