# Rick & Morty



## Overview ##
In this project we make a web page **with a single html**, in which we **download the information from an API**. In my case, I will use the free API of **Rick and Morty**, a well-known cartoon series.

So, what I want is to show the detailed information of the episodes, characters and locations.

## Objective ##
* Obtain information from third-party APIâ€™s
* Improve your knowledge
* Introduce typescript in your code.
* Learn more about how to integrate APIS and its interaction with the client
* Improve your skills in obtaining asynchronous information by using AJAX
* Structure a WEB project in a clear and orderly manner

## Konwledge Implementation ##
* **HTML:** Implementation of new structure of Bootstrap, new tags, organization.
* **CSS:** Implement css styles and combine them with Bootstrap's
* **TS:** Becoming familiar with all concepts of typing information

## Features ##
Information that you should obtain from the API of each section:

**Episodes Guide:** In this section you will explore a list of episodes, proving details like: 
* Name
* Air date
* Episode code

**Characters:**
In this section you will explore a list of characters. Each character display a card information  proving details like: 
* Name
* Status
* Species
* Gender 
* Image

**Locations:**
FInally, in this section application provide information about locations featured in the show. 
* Name
* Type
* Dimension


## Installation ## 
To install and open the project we must open a new local folder and **clone the repository** with the following link:

* https://github.com/ebroto7/Rick-Morty.git

We must also **add the bootstrap** library installing it by console. Follow the steps indicated on their website

* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/

Finally we must **install typescript** in our code editor, in my case visual code studio

## Challenges ## 

* My first challenge was to start the project creating the repository, installing typescript and bootstrap

* After this, propose the project, for this, make a first design and create a clickUp with the tasks that you thought of, giving them an index of importance.

* What cost me the most was the combination of css styles with bootstrap

* Another challenge was to create interfaces and enum for the objects returned by the API

* Making the information containers and reusing them correctly also gave me more than one headache


## Conclusion ##

In conclusion, when I realized that the project was going to be very repetitive, I saw that it was going to be easier than I thought when I received the challenge.
In the end, I had to download a list from the api, iterate it to perform functions individually and create the container to display the information of one of the elements, download another list and repeat the process.

Then it was an iterative process of creating functions and styles. And go correcting some mistakes
