        <h3> Friday 4 </h3>
        <p> - I start the day by reading the documentation and doing a little brainstorming on how I want to approach the project and what things I want to do.
            <br>- I create a ClickUp, to order all the tasks
            <br>- And make me a small diagram of how I want to visually organize the web.
            <br>- From there, the project began. For this, what I do is create the project in VSC and local, create the repository in Github, clone it and link it to the local one. Once I have the local repository, I start the installation of the typscript and Bootstrap packages with which I am going to carry out the project.
            <br>- Once the project is initialized, I start by creating the web outline in html and giving some basic styles in css to be able to visualize what I want.
            <br>- The next step would be to import the interfaces that I was going to use when importing the API data (I admit that here I was ahead of what I was playing)
